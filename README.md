# MSLearn-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Predicting customer churn using ML (Telco dataset) ‚Äî MS Learn project.

This project is part of Microsoft Learn‚Äôs AI/ML module. It focuses on predicting customer churn using classical machine learning algorithms like Decision Trees and XGBoost, along with data preprocessing, SMOTE for imbalance handling, and business insight extraction.

## 1. Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**, publicly available on Kaggle. It includes customer demographics, services subscribed, and account information.

* **Source:** [Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
* **Key Features:**
    * `gender`, `SeniorCitizen`, `Partner`, `Dependents` (Demographics)
    * `tenure`, `PhoneService`, `MultipleLines`, `InternetService`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `StreamingTV`, `StreamingMovies` (Services subscribed)
    * `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges` (Account Information)
    * `Churn` (Target Variable: 'Yes' if churned, 'No' otherwise)
    * **Rows**: 7043
- **Features**: 21 columns (after dropping `customerID`)

### Target Variable
- `Churn`: 
  - `Yes`: customer has churned
  - `No`: customer is retained

---

## 2. Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Äì data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` ‚Äì data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` ‚Äì preprocessing, ML models, evaluation
  - `xgboost` ‚Äì advanced boosting models
  - `imblearn` ‚Äì SMOTE for class imbalance handling
  - `pickle` ‚Äì model serialization,saving encoders and models

### ‚úÖ 3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- `customerID` column dropped (non-predictive).
- `TotalCharges` column was originally of type `object`.
  - Invalid string entries (`" "`, `"<NA>"`, `""`, `"nan"`) were removed.
  - Column successfully converted to `float64`.
- No missing values remain after cleaning.

### ‚úÖ 4. Target Distribution Analysis
- `Churn` column shows **class imbalance**:
  - Majority: `No` (non-churners)
  - Minority: `Yes` (churners)
- This imbalance will be handled using **SMOTE** in preprocessing.

### ‚úÖ 5. Numerical Feature Analysis (Ongoing)
- Histograms plotted with KDE curves for features like:
  - `MonthlyCharges`
  - `TotalCharges`
  - `tenure`

## üìä Sample Visualizations

> *(Add graphs/screenshots if uploading to GitHub)*

- `countplot()` for target distribution
- Histograms for numerical features

---

## üß† Insights So Far

1. `customerID` removed as it's not useful for modeling.
2. Handled invalid entries in `TotalCharges` and converted it to float.
3. No missing values remain in the dataset.
4. Target variable `Churn` is imbalanced and needs balancing.
5. Initial visual analysis of numerical features completed.

#### Encoding Categorical Features
Label Encoding: Used for binary columns (gender, Partner, Dependents, etc.)

One-Hot Encoding: Used for multi-category columns (InternetService, Contract, PaymentMethod, etc.)


### ‚öñÔ∏è 7. Handling Class Imbalance with SMOTE
Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance class distribution in training data:



### ü§ñ 8. Model Training
Trained multiple machine learning models using the balanced training set:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

---

### üîÅ 9. Cross-Validation (5-Fold)
Performed 5-Fold Cross-Validation using F1-score as the performance metric:
Collected F1-score results for each model for comparison.

---

### üìà 10. Evaluation (Next Step)
Models will be evaluated using:

Confusion Matrix

F1 Score

ROC AUC Score

Classification Report

ROC Curve & Precision-Recall Curve Visualizations

----

### üíæ 11. Model Saving (Planned)
Will serialize:

Trained models

Encoders / transformers

Using pickle for deployment or future use.

---

### üöÄ 12. (Optional) Deployment
Planned deployment:

As a Flask API for serving predictions

Hosting on Azure App Service or Streamlit as a web interface
